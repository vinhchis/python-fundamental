# loop in python
1. for loops
2. while loops

## For loops
1. loop over a sequence
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code to be executed
```
2. for range
```python
for i in range(5):
    # code to be executed
```

## While loops
```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed

```

# Control loop with break, continue and else keyword

-   `break` - Exits the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.
-   `continue` - Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.
for in
-   `else` - Optional part that runs when the loop finishes normally (i.e., without being terminated by break).
